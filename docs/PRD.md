# AI Agents - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
AI Agents is a flexible and extensible framework for building and orchestrating AI-powered agents. The system enables developers to create specialized agents that can perform specific tasks, chain multiple agents together for complex operations, and build interactive assistants.

## Goals
- Create a simple, modular framework for building AI agents
- Enable easy integration of different LLM providers
- Provide tools for agent orchestration and communication
- Support real-world use cases with minimal setup

## Target Users
- Developers building AI-powered applications
- Researchers experimenting with agent-based systems
- Teams looking to automate tasks using AI agents

## Core Features

### 1. Agent Framework
- Base agent classes for different types of agents
  - TaskAgent: Single-purpose agents for specific tasks
  - ChainAgent: Agents that coordinate with other agents
  - AssistantAgent: Interactive agents for user assistance

### 2. LLM Integration
- Support for multiple LLM providers:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Azure OpenAI
  - DeepSeek
  - Gemini
  - Local LLM support

### 3. Tool System
- Built-in tools for common operations:
  - Web scraping
  - Screenshot capture and verification
  - Search functionality
  - File operations

### 4. Orchestration
- Agent communication and coordination
- Task scheduling and management
- Error handling and recovery
- Logging and monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- Python-based implementation
- Modular design for easy extension
- Virtual environment for dependency management
- Configuration through environment variables

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Key libraries managed through requirements.txt
- Environment configuration via .env file
