### 3. Tool System
- Built-in tools for common operations:
  - Web scraping
  - Screenshot capture and verification
  - Search functionality
  - File operations

### 4. Orchestration
- Agent communication and coordination
- Task scheduling and management
- Error handling and recovery
- Logging and monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- Python-based implementation
